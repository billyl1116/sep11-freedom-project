# Entry 1

## Intro
In this entry we started of by looking at all the tool that's was available for us, and I pick **kaboom.js** because I want to make a game. And my idea was to make a dinosaur running game.

## Kaboom
After choosing the tool, we start learning about them. One of the way I found that's helpful for me are, watching video in youtube and getting a idea about the tool, and after I will go to the tool [website](https://kaboomjs.com/) and take the code and use it on jsbin, so tinker with the tool and see what can I make out of the code.

## EDP
We are still in the beginning of the project, so what we are doing right now is learning about the tool, and brainstorming about what we want to make. And in the next part I would start creating some small object.

## Skill
By researching and tinkering with the tool, I learn how to learn code faster, in the way that I would understand it. And I learn how to filter useless information and get to the part where I need it so I don't waste time on unnecessary things.
