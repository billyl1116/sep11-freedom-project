# Entry 6
##### 5/27/25


### Context


At the time, I'm basically at the end of my 11th grade, and I am also done with my project, my MVP and beyond MVP. And during this entry I showcased my project using a slide I created for my classmate. And I also did an elevator pitch for showcasing my project to judges .


### Takeaways


Some takeaways I had for my elevator pitch were not giving enough detail. Because all I did was talk about what my game is about and I have a lot of time left for other things. When I could have talk about my tool, my challenges and something I like about my own project


And some **TakeAway** My presentation to my classmate were, not adding the challenges I had when creating my project, and I also didn't add a takeaway for my project, so next time I need to focus on my ending more.


### conclution 

This project I made I had a lot of fun in it, and it really got me into game creation. In the future I would try more tools on creating a game of my desire.
